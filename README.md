#A subject during my internship.

**It was for a company that I cannot write the name**

The goal of this project was to communicate between a smartphone and a Siemens's PLC. The second 
goal, the one I made myself, was to create a library to simplify the use of Moka7 in Android.

I used Moka7 to communicate and a S7-1200 PLC from Siemens. I created a library to simplify the use 
of Moka7, called PLC, check it out and improve it as you wish with pull-requests. All of the 
documentation is written inside the code under the form of JavaDoc and normal comments.
